## Design Pattern in Spring
# Creational
# Singleton
+ Spring contains bean in spring IoC container
+ By default, Spring creates all beans as singletons.
+ By changing, the bean scope from singleton to prototype using the @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE) annotation.

# Factory
+ Spring defines the BeanFactory interface as an abstraction of a bean container

# Structural
# Proxy
+ 1.@Transactional
+ 2. the use of JDK dynamic proxies and CGLIB proxies to implement the dependency injection (DI) mechanism.
        When a bean is configured for DI using an interface,
        Spring creates a JDK dynamic proxy object that implements the interface and delegates method calls to the actual bean object

# Decorator
+ HandlerInterceptor
+ DelegatingFilterProxy

# Behavior
# Template Method
+ JdbcTemplate

# Observer
+ ApplicationEventPublisher
+ @EventListener

# Command
+ JdbcTemplate

## Design Pattern in Project
# Proxy in servicePackage

# Builder in payloadPackage
